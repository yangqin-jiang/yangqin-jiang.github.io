# üßê About Me

Hi there! I am a 2-year PhD student in [Computer Science at the ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch/), under the supervision of Prof. [Florian Tram√®r](https://floriantramer.com/), and a member of the [Secure and Private AI (SPY) Lab](https://spylab.ai/).
I completed my master's degree in [Software Engineering at Zhejiang University](http://www.cst.zju.edu.cn/cstenglish/main.htm) in March 2023, advised by Prof. [Chao Wu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=gpTPt58AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree at Hainan University in July 2020.

<!-- Previously, I interned at Sony AI for half a year, focusing on AI security and model compression. Before that, I also interned at Tencent Youtu Lab for one year, exploring federated learning and adversarial attacks. -->

### **Research Interests**: 
<!--  I am mainly interested in data-centric AI or data-driven machine learning, including data privacy, data security, data efficiency, and data-related applications. My research investigates how to elevate data-centric approaches to improving the performance of machine learning models. Previously, I focused on the following research topics:
- Data Efficiency: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation, Dataset Condensation
- Data Security: Adversarial Examples, Model Inversion
- Data Privacy: Membership Inference Attack
- Data-related Applications: Federated Learning, Imbalanced Learning, Continual Learning
 -->


ü§î For my PhD study,  my primary focus is on examining the potential <font color="red">security and privacy risks in ML systems</font>, both in their current state and as they evolve in the future. My research aims to uncover vulnerabilities and develop strategies to mitigate these risks, ultimately contributing to the development of more secure and privacy-preserving machine learning technologies.

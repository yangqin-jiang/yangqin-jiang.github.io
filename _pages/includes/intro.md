# üßê About Me

Hi there! I am a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at HKU, under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/chaoh/home). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree at Harbin Institute of Technology in July 2022.

**Research Interests:**

My research interests encompass <span style="color:#007acc; font-weight:bold;">recommendation systems</span>, <span style="color:#007acc; font-weight:bold;">large language models</span>, and <span style="color:#007acc; font-weight:bold;">intelligent agents</span>. I am committed to tackling the challenges faced by <span style="color:#ff7043; font-weight:bold;">recommendation systems</span> across various scenarios, utilizing technologies such as <span style="font-weight:bold;">self-supervised learning</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">large language models</span>. Looking ahead, I plan to delve into topics related to <span style="color:#ff7043; font-weight:bold;">intelligent agents</span>, with the goal of developing <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#388e3c;">personalized</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#388e3c;">efficient agent systems</span>.

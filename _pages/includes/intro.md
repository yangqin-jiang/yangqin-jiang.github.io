# üßê About Me

Hi there! I am a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at HKU, under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/chaoh/home). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree at Harbin Institute of Technology in July 2022.

**Research Interests:**

My research interests encompass recommendation systems, large language models, and intelligent agents. I am committed to tackling the challenges faced by recommendation systems across various scenarios, utilizing technologies such as self-supervised learning and large language models. Looking ahead, I plan to delve into topics related to intelligent agents, with the goal of developing personalized and efficient agent systems.

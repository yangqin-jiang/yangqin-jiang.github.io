# 🧐 About Me

Hi there! I am a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at HKU, under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/chaoh/home). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree at Harbin Institute of Technology in July 2022.

**Research Interests:**

My research interests encompass <span style="color:#007acc; font-weight:bold;">intelligent agents</span> (such as memory, self-evolution, and GUI agents), <span style="color:#007acc; font-weight:bold;">large language models</span>, and <span style="color:#007acc; font-weight:bold;">recommendation systems</span>. I am committed to tackling the challenges faced by recommendation systems across various scenarios, utilizing technologies such as self-supervised learning and generative diffusion models.

**Looking ahead, I aim to develop practical and efficient agent systems to address real-world challenges.**

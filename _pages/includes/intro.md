# üßê About Me

Hi there! I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at HKU, under the supervision of [Dr. Chao Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/chaoh/home). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree at Harbin Institute of Technology in July 2022.

**Research Interests:**

My research interests include recommendation systems, large language models, and agents. I am dedicated to addressing the challenges faced by recommendation systems in different scenarios using technologies such as self-supervised learning and large language models. In the future, I plan to explore topics related to agents, aiming to build personalized and efficient agent systems. 

I warmly welcome collaborators who are interested in related topics.
